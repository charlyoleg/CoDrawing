I'm a *pythonistas libriste* and I have rediscovered the joy to express things by drawing. This happened when I tried to illustrate the website MesCarottes.com_. I have found the amazing *vectorial graphics editor* Inkscape_. It lets me reconquer my drawing skill. After several years of usage, Inkscape_ keeps surprising me with its numerous efficient features. Now I use it daily not only for illustrations but also for `documentation draft`_.

For me, drawing is a skill as important as the ability to write. A drawing can be so universal and self-understanding. New concept are difficult to explain with a text because words are too connoted or imprecise or even missing. A drawing is much more straight forward to communicate on thing that doesn't exist yet.
