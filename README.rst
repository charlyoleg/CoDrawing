CoDrawing
=========

**CoDrawing** is workspace attempting to make easier the co-creation of drawings.

The **CoDrawing framework** and the drawings are available at https://github.com/charlyoleg/CoDrawing under the `CC BY-SA 3.0`_ license. In the *studio* directory, you find the drawings in perpetual construction. You can either enhance one of the existing drawings or start a new drawing.

**CoDrawing** uses the *software development* collaborative tool git_ to organize the collaboration between drawers. To take part to this drawing co-creation, use the most appropriate GitHub_ collaboration process:

- Propose pull-requests
- Ask for write access to the *repository* 
- Or fork the *repository*

Drawings are created with Inkscape_. Use the *dynamic import* feature when you add an object or character to a drawing. This minimizes conflict when several people are working simultaneously on the same drawing.

Git_ structures the collaboration and lets many drawers acting on the same work of arts. This reduces drastically the number of rules and constraints to respect to make the collaboration effective. Read the `CoDrawing documentation`_ for further information on the methodology and good practices.


How to start?
-------------

- Install Inkscape
- Clone the `CoDrawing repository`_
- Choose a drawing in the directory *studio*
- Add your drawing touch
- Use GitHub_ to share your work
